        <h1>Halfus Wyrmbreaker</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Halfus Wyrmbreaker is the first boss in the Bastion of Twilight raid.</p>
        <p> This encounter involves several drakes and whelps that must be managed or killed early.</p>
        <h2>Drakes and Whelps</h2>
        <p>Halfus is accompanied by four drakes and a group of whelps. Each week,</p>
        <p> Two of these drakes will be active, providing Halfus with different abilities:</p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nether Scion</strong>: Increases Halfus's attack speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Storm Rider</strong>: Grants Halfus the Shadow Nova ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Slate Dragon</strong>: Occasionally stuns Halfus.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Warden</strong>: Grants Halfus the ability to shoot fireballs.</li>
            <li><strong>Orphaned Emerald Whelps</strong>: Reduces the damage dealt by Halfus's Furious Roar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1: Drakes and Whelps</h3>
        <p>At the start of the fight, your raid needs to decide which drakes to free first based on the combination present. Freeing drakes removes the associated ability from Halfus and provides your raid with a buff. Focus on freeing the drakes and killing them one by one.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 2: Halfus</h3>
        <p>Once all the drakes and whelps are dealt with, focus on burning down Halfus. He will gain <em>Frenzied Assault</em>, increasing his damage and attack speed as his health gets lower. Healers need to be prepared for the increased damage during this phase.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Berserk</strong>: Enrages after 6 minutes, increasing damage dealt by 500%.</li>
            <li><strong>Furious Roar</strong>: Stuns the raid and deals damage every 0.5 seconds for 1.5 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadow Nova</strong>: Interruptible AoE damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Fireball</strong>: Randomly targets raid members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Valiona & Theralion</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Valiona & Theralion are the second encounter in the Bastion of Twilight</p>
        <p>They are two dragons that periodically switch bewteen phyical and twilight realms.</p>
        <h2>Phase 1: Engagement</h2>
        <p>The encouter starts with both dragons in the physical realm.</p>
        <p>The raid must manage abilities from both dragons at the same time.</p></p>
        <ul>
            <h1>Valiona's abilities</h1>
            <li><strong>Blackout</strong>: creates a void zone on the floor (don't touch) </li>
            <li><strong>Devouring Flames</strong>: Targets a random player and spew flames on them.</li>
            <h1>Theralion's abilities</h1>
            <li><strong>Dazzling Destruction</strong>: Targets random players with a fireball with splash damage</li>
            <li><strong>Engulfing magic</strong>: Applies a debuff that splits damage across team unless not stacked (1shot's player instead)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Phase 2: Twilight</h2>
        <p>At certain health thresholds, the dragons switch to the twilight realm.</p>
        
        <h3>Twilight Realm Mechanics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Breath</strong>: <em>Valiona</em> marks areas for twilight flames, while Theralion performs an aerial assault.</li>
            <li><strong>Twilight Meteorite</strong>: Targets a player and leaves behind a damaging void zone upon impact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>Move together as a group and use cooldowns when bloodlust is active, Stack up when someone gets <em>Engulfing Magic</em> or else you'd lose a party member</p>
